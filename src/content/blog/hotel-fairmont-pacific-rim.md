The Fairmont Pacific Rim is one of those hotels that makes Vancouver feel like a truly international city. Floor to ceiling glass, direct views of the inlet, mountains in the background. You step in from Burrard Street and the city outside becomes a painting.

I've walked past this hotel probably a hundred times. Staying in it is a different thing entirely.

## The Room

I was on the 18th floor with a harbour view. The room is modern, clean lines, nothing fussy. The bed has the kind of pillows that hotels charge extra for and should — plump, cool, and somehow both firm and soft at once. I slept ten hours without meaning to.

The bathroom is marble and well-lit, which is more important than it sounds. The rain shower has good pressure. These are the details that separate a $400 hotel from a $600 hotel, and the Pacific Rim gets them right.

## What Could Be Better

Breakfast is expensive even by Vancouver standards, and the lobby can feel slightly corporate during conference season. Neither is a dealbreaker, but worth knowing if you're sensitive to that kind of thing.
