JW Marriott Parq Vancouver is the kind of hotel that makes Vancouver feel easy: you're planted in the entertainment district, steps from big-event energy, but the hotel itself leans calm and polished.

If your ideal stay is "walk everywhere, spa when tired, good food without hunting," this one fits.

# The Experience

## Location: event-weekend easy mode
You're right by BC Place, with quick access to downtown (and a very short "late-night walk home" after games or concerts). The hotel address is **39 Smithe Street, Vancouver, BC**.

## Rooms: modern, bright, no-fuss luxury
Expect a clean, contemporary look—big windows, a neutral palette, and a layout that feels designed for actual downtime (not just for photos). If you're sensitive to noise on event nights, it's worth requesting a quieter exposure and a higher floor.

## Wellness: Spa by JW + the Aqua Lounge
The wellness floor is the signature here. **Spa by JW** is on-site, and the **Aqua Lounge** is set up for recovery: hydrotherapy tub, space to stretch/yoga, loungers, and views. (Important note: it's *not* positioned as a standard swimming pool.)

## Food & drink: real options without leaving the building
The on-property lineup is strong for a downtown hotel:
- **Honey Salt** for a relaxed, "BC ingredients" comfort vibe
- **The Victor** for steak/seafood energy (great when you want a proper dinner without planning)
- **D/6 Lounge** when you want cocktails + rooftop atmosphere

# What I'd book again
- A higher-floor room (more light, more "city escape" feeling)
- A spa slot + Aqua Lounge time as an actual itinerary item
- Dinner at The Victor on one night, Honey Salt on another (two different moods, same building)

# Good to know
- This hotel is connected to the larger **Parq Vancouver** complex (including a casino), so the area can feel busy at peak times.
- If you want a "pool day," set expectations: think hydrotherapy + lounge, not laps.

# Verdict
A high-function, modern luxury stay in a location that's hard to beat for events—and the wellness floor is the reason it feels like an escape instead of just a convenient address.
